About Diagramming tools used : 

  Currently for free alternative reason, the C&S symbols collection has been made with the famous free software Libre office and his diagramming tool Libre office draw. 
  You can still export them in other formats but the compatibility will largely depend on your targeted extensions and your O.S. platforms. 
  To ensure maximum compatibility with your own diagramming softwares, this symbols collection (based on simple boxes and connectors) can be easily replicated in the native formats of your chosen softwares like Microsoft Visio, Smartdraw, Edraw or even vector softwares like Adobe illustrator or Inkscape.

  - Libre office :  You can  download libre office (use version 4 for complete compatibility)  and use his diagramming editor tool : Libre Office Drawing  : http://libreoffice.org
  - Screencasts Video Maker  like Youtube movie maker : http://makeyoutubevideo.com 
  - Graphic editor with screen captures capability (for png and jpg files) like Adobe Photoshop, SnagIt or Gimp
